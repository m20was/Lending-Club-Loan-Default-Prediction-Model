# Loan Default Prediction Model

## Situation

In the financial sector, accurately predicting loan defaults is crucial for risk management and decision-making. Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform, provides a rich dataset of loan information that can be leveraged to build predictive models. The challenge lies in processing and analyzing this large-scale dataset (2.6 GB) to create accurate and reliable loan default prediction models.

The dataset contains a wide range of features including loan characteristics, borrower information, and credit data. However, it presents several challenges:

1. Large volume of data (2.6 GB) requiring efficient processing techniques
2. Mix of numerical and categorical variables
3. Presence of missing values and potential outliers
4. Imbalanced classes (defaulted loans typically represent a smaller portion of the dataset)
5. Complex relationships between features that may affect loan default probability

## Task

The main objectives of this project were to:

1. Develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting loan defaults using the Lending Club dataset
2. Process and analyze the large-scale dataset efficiently
3. Implement and compare multiple machine learning algorithms
